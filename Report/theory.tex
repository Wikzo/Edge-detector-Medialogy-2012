\chapter{Theory about edge Detection}
\section{Edge definition}
An edge in an image is basically a place in an image where there is a contrast between two points.

\citet{visual_story} describes an edge as the apparent line around the borders of a two-dimensional object.

Another definition is given by \citep{ip_book} who writes that an edge in an image is defined as a position where there is a significant change in gray-level values.

\section{Edge detection}
An edge in a gray scale image occurs when there is a transition in gray level over an 
amount of pixels. A perfect edge would be a transition from black to white over one pixel 
as shown on figure 1. In many images, edges like these wont occur (unless itâ€™s a binary 
image). The transition will be blurred spreading the transition over more pixels, resulting 
in a slope-like profile of the gray level transition seen on figure 2. Here the edge is spread 
over more pixels and will show as a wider edge instead of the 1-pixel transition that 
shows as a 1-pixel edge. We might say the thickness of the edge is defined by the length 
of the ramp that in the gray level profile.\fxnote{DETTE SKAL SKRIVES SELV!!}
